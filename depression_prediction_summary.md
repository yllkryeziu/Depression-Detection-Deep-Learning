# Depression Prediction Results Summary

## Overview
This report summarizes the results of using a trained CNN10 model to predict depression classification on test mel-spectrograms with patient-level majority voting.

## Model Configuration
- **Model**: CNN10-New (Binary Classification)
- **Input**: Mel-spectrogram features (.npy files)
- **Output**: Binary classification (0 = Not Depressed, 1 = Depressed)
- **Architecture**: CNN10 feature extractor + custom classification head
- **Device**: CPU

## Dataset Information
- **Test Samples**: 3,066 audio snippets
- **Unique Patients**: 36
- **Data Source**: ExtendedDAIC-16k-fixed dataset
- **Ground Truth Distribution**:
  - Depressed patients: 13 (36.1%)
  - Not depressed patients: 23 (63.9%)

## Prediction Methodology
1. **Snippet-level Prediction**: Each audio snippet was processed individually through the CNN10 model
2. **Majority Voting**: For each patient, the final prediction was determined by majority vote across all their snippets
3. **Confidence Scoring**: Average confidence of the majority class predictions

## Key Observations

### Model Strengths
1. **High Sensitivity**: The model correctly identified 84.6% of depressed patients, showing good ability to detect depression
2. **Consistent Predictions**: Most patients had unanimous or strong majority votes across their snippets
3. **Reasonable Confidence**: Average confidence scores ranged from 54.5% to 73.3%

### Model Limitations
1. **Low Specificity**: Only 34.8% of non-depressed patients were correctly identified, indicating high false positive rate
2. **Class Imbalance Impact**: The model tends to over-predict depression
3. **Moderate Overall Accuracy**: 52.8% overall accuracy suggests room for improvement

### Confidence Analysis
- **High Confidence Predictions** (>65%): Mostly correct for non-depressed patients
- **Medium Confidence Predictions** (55-65%): Mixed results
- **Lower Confidence Predictions** (<55%): Generally less reliable

## Output Files Generated
1. **`depression_predictions.csv`**: Patient-level predictions with majority voting results
